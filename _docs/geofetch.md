`geofetch` is a command-line utility that converts GEO or SRA accessions into PEP projects. You provide an accession (or a spreadsheet with a list of accessions), and `geofetch` with produce the two components of a PEP: the project config file and the sample annotation file. `geofetch` will also download the data from SRA, so your project will be ready for direct input into any PEP-compatible tool.
