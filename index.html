        The <b>Corces Lab</b> is part of the <b>Gladstone Institutes for Neurological Disease and Data Science and Biotechnology</b> and the <b>UCSF Department of Neurology</b>. We combine integrative epigenomic profiling of primary human disease tissue with functional perturbations using in vitro and murine models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. The lab is located in the Gladstone Institutes on the <b>UCSF Mission Bay</b> campus.
