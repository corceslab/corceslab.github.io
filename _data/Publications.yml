  description: 'The advent of large-scale single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling has accelerated our ability to map gene regulatory landscapes,
  but has outpaced the development of robust, scalable software to rapidly extract biological meaning from these data. Here we present a software
  suite for single-cell analysis of regulatory chromatin in R (ArchR; [www.ArchRProject.com](www.ArchRProject.com)) that enables fast and comprehensive
  analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. ArchR provides an intuitive, user-focused interface for complex single-cell analyses enabling
  the analysis of over 1.2 million single cells within 8 hours on a standard Unix laptop.'

  description: 'We develop a machine learning classifier to integrate multi-omic epigenetic data and predict dozens of functional SNPs,
  nominating gene and cellular targets for previously orphaned GWAS loci. These predictions both inform well-studied disease-relevant genes,
  such as BIN1 in microglia for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and reveal novel gene-disease associations, such as STAB1 in microglia and MAL in
  oligodendrocytes for Parkinson’s disease (PD). This work greatly expands our understanding of inherited variation in AD and PD and provides
  a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of noncoding regulatory variation in disease.'

  description: 'We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709
  transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known
  cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of
  putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of cancers and nominates long-range
  gene-regulatory interactions in cancer. Moreover, these data pinpoint noncoding mutations that
  drive enhancer activation and may affect patient survival. These results suggest a
  systematic approach to understanding the noncoding genome in disease to advance diagnosis and therapy.'

  description: 'We present Omni-ATAC, an improved ATAC-seq protocol for chromatin accessibility profiling that works across multiple
  applications with substantial improvement of signal-to-background ratio and information content. The Omni-ATAC
  protocol generates high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from almost any starting material, from cell lines to archival
  frozen tissue samples and 50-µm sections. Moreover, Omni-ATAC saves money through fraction of reads in peaks and lower fraction
  of reads mapping to the mitochondrial chromosome.'

  description: 'We define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscapes in 13 human primary blood cell types that
  span the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that the enhancer landscape better reflects cell identity than mRNA
  levels, we enable enhancer cytometry for enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We identify regulators
  governing hematopoietic differentiation and further show the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human
  diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromatin accessibility uncovers unique regulatory evolution in cancer cells with
  a progressively increasing mutation burden. Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to
  disparate developmental stages.'
