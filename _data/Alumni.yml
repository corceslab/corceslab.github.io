  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area, and went to the University of Washington in Seattle to pursue a degree in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental
  Biology. While there, I developed an interest in disease mechanisms and drug development. Under the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Promislow, I joined a project
  working with the model organism Drosophila to study how tau protein affects the transcriptome of individual brain cells. Additionally, I started my own
  project focused on the aging drug, rapamycin, and its affect on development within Drosophila larvae of different genotypes. My work concluded with the
  production of single-nuclei transcriptome data of whole larvae raised on rapamycin. After graduating in 2022, I joined the Corces lab to continue working
  with single-cell technologies and neurodegenerative disease, now focused on understanding how genetic variants contribute to Parkison's Disease. Outside
  of lab, I enjoy playing volleyball, hiking, reading, and making art."

  description: "Bridging the gap between science and human diseases requires cutting-edge tools such as epigenetics and CRISPR! I was born and raised
  in Korea and went to Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) to study biomedical engineering. During my first internship under
  Dr. Jong Bhak, studying the GWAS data of the Ulsan population, I discovered the beauty of genomic research and its ability to uncover hidden gems
  in our DNA. I pursued additional internships at Seoul National University (SNU), ranging from epidemiology with Dr. Sue-kyung Park at SNU to
  genomics with Dr. Jong-il Kim at SNU, where I learned about finding disease-related mutations and validating them using organoids. Working in such
  a complex and exciting field of science has given me a deep appreciation for the power of genomic research. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree
  under the advisory of Seung Woo Cho, studying changes in epigenetic patterns in human diseases using ATAC-seq and validating the results with
  CRISPR/Cas9. I’m excited to have a great opportunity to improve my research skills and perform bulk ATAC data analysis to investigate drug response
  during my year-long visit to the Corces lab."

  description: "I am a high school student at The Harker School in San Jose, California. Growing up in the Bay Area, I was exposed to computer science
  at an early age through competitions, courses, and events all around me. My introduction to neurodegenerative diseases came later at the start of
  high school, when I wrote an essay with Dr. Peter Tass on vibrotactile coordinated reset neuromodulation, his novel, non-intrusive treatment for
  Parkinson's Disease. Following that experience, I spent two years researching and developing an audiovisual emotion classification platform powered
  by deep neural networks to help individuals with autism. Now, as part of the Corces Lab, I'm combining my interests in machine learning and
  neurological diseases to predict the effect of non-coding variants in Alzheimer's Disease and create a tool for researchers to test their own
  variants of interest. Outside of the lab, I enjoy filmmaking, graphics design, hip-hop dance, and debate."

  description: "I was born in Taiwan and moved to the Bay Area when I was twelve to study piano performance at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Pre-College. My
  love for music then took me to Columbia University in NYC, where I could be challenged intellectually while still being a part of the classical music scene. At Columbia,
  soaking up everything like a sponge, I quickly discovered the elegance and beauty of biology, especially how neuronal patterns of activity give rise to sensory and behavioral responses.
  From there, I decided to pursue a bachelor's in Neuroscience and Behavior and began my research journey in the lab of Richard Axel, studying the functional architecture
  of innate olfactory avoidance in Drosophila Melanogaster. I focused on the V glomerulus and the DA2 glomerulus, which are glomeruli that detect CO2 and geosmin, to
  understand how aversive channels elicit aversive behaviors. Through the experience, I gained a deep appreciation for brain systems and the intricacies of systems biology.
  I also yearn to see how basic science findings can transform into applied therapeutics in a precision context. Now at the Corces Lab, I am working towards that goal by
  delving into the underpinnings of neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases through a gene-regulatory and cell type-mechanistic lens. I am interested in using
  single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics, alongside massively parallel reporter assays, to prioritize noncoding SNPs that are associated with the disease."

  description: "I was born and raised in the East Bay Area, California, leaving in 2017 to attend Cal Poly Humboldt for a Bachelor’s in
  Plant Biology. While there, I had the opportunity to work in the lab of Dr. Mihai Tomescu, where I helped identify a plant from 400
  million years ago. My work with Dr. Tomescu culminated in a scientific paper recently submitted to the American Journal of Botany. After
  graduation, I returned to the East Bay and joined Bio-Rad as a research associate. There I worked to develop innovative PCR reagents and
  optimize a novel droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing workflow. Most recently I made the move to San Francisco to join the Corces Lab
  at the Gladstone Institutes. In the Corces lab, I’ll be using my molecular biology expertise to perform single-cell multi-omic experiments
  in order to ultimately further our understanding of how genetic factors contribute to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease. Outside of work,
  I enjoy gardening and volunteering in hospice."

  description: "I grew up in Idaho, born to Argentinian parents. After falling in love with biology late in high school thanks to Campbell Biology's
  Tour of the Cell chapter, I went to Washington State University (WSU) to pursue a bachelor's in biochemistry. While at WSU, I fell in love with
  genome regulation while working on transposable elements and the variety of ways they create genomic and epigenetic variation.  In 2014, I graduated
  and went on to pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford University in the lab of Nidhi Bhutani. There, I studied DNA methylation, specifically the regulation of
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics by the TET family of enzymes in the context of skeletal development and disease, including dissecting the relationship
  between 5hmC deposition and SOX9 transcription factor activity. During graduate school, I also became interested in pursuing the use of single-cell
  technologies to understand how the epigenome shapes cell fate, and specifically how it can store information about environmental conditions like chronic
  inflammation that cause disease. Now, I'm combing these two interests to study mechanisms of resilience to AD in the Corces lab."
