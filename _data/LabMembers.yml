  description: "I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early \"pre-leukemic\" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease."

  description: "I grew up in Montclair, NJ, and later moved to New England to study computational neuroscience and statistics
  at Harvard College. As an undergraduate, I worked in the labs of Dr. Jeff Lichtman and Dr. Florian Engert, mapping human and
  larval zebrafish connectomes to explore the structural principles of brain organization. I then shifted my focus to motor
  systems neuroscience in the lab of Dr. Bence Ölveczky, using statistical modeling to probe how neurons in the rodent basal
  ganglia flexibly adapt over time to support learning. After graduating in 2024, I moved to the West Coast to begin my PhD
  in neuroscience at UCSF. I’m now applying my interests in neuroscience and statistics to questions in neurodegenerative
  disease and genomics. In the Corces Lab, I plan to leverage single-cell analysis and machine learning to investigate cell
  type-specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer’s Disease. Outside of the lab, I love climbing mountains, seeing
  live music, and trying (but occasionally succeeding) to solve NYTimes crosswords."

  description: "Growing up in rural Rhode Island, I was raised in the outdoors and turned this into a passion for biology with the help
  of dedicated early educators. Deciding to make a career out of this, I made the trek to Providence to study Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology at Brown University. There, I began my journey in research in the lab of Ashley Webb, investigating how the Forkhead Box O family
  of transcription factors (FOXOs) regulate stem cell homeostasis in the brain. I concurrently examined this functionality under
  physiological and pathological conditions, focusing the majority of my efforts on investigating a role for FOXOs in the maintenance of
  cancer stem cell quiescence in the context of high-grade brain cancer. Wanting to continue research on human disease, I switched coasts
  after graduation to pursue my PhD in the Biomedical Sciences Program at UCSF. Here, as a member of the Corces Lab, I aim to pair
  multi-omics with organoid and iPSC-based model systems to pinpoint and validate the epigenetic underpinnings driving AD and PD.
  In particular, I am interested in the interplay between such drivers and their contextual relationships in a cell-type and cell-state
  specific manner. Outside of lab, you'll find me working with UCSF's Science Education Partnership, exploring new ways to consume coffee,
  or making my way to a beach or a mountain."

  exercise in early life improve learning and memory?\" My investigation, which leveraged bulk CUT&RUN and RNA sequencing
  techniques, discovered support for a mechanism of epigenetic priming. Along the way, I developed a novel transgenic mouse line
  and a novel technique, SIT, for the cell-specific simultaneous isolation of nuclei and RNA from a single homogenate. I am
  excited to investigate memory at the other end of the life-cycle as part of the Corces Lab. I want to leverage multi-omic and
