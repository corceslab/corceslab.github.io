  description: 'I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early "pre-leukemic" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer''s and Parkinson''s
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease.'

  description: 'I grew up in Idaho, born to Argentinian parents. After falling in love with biology late in high school thanks to Campbell Biology''s
  Tour of the Cell chapter, I went to Washington State University (WSU) to pursue a bachelor''s in biochemistry. While at WSU, I fell in love with
  genome regulation while working on transposable elements and the variety of ways they create genomic and epigenetic variation.  In 2014, I graduated
  and went on to pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford University in the lab of Nidhi Bhutani. There, I studied DNA methylation, specifically the regulation of
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics by the TET family of enzymes in the context of skeletal development and disease, including dissecting the relationship
  between 5hmC deposition and SOX9 transcription factor activity.  During graduate school, I also became interested in pursuing the use of single-cell
  technologies to understand how the epigenome shapes cell fate, and specifically how it can store information about environmental conditions like chronic
  inflammation that cause disease. Now, I''m combing these two interests to study mechanisms of resilience to AD in the Corces lab.'

  description: 'I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Molecular & Cell Biology and German at the University of California, Berkeley. My introduction
 to biology research was in Oskar Hallatschek''s lab, where I worked with Dr. Jona Kayser on recombination-based tools for studying mechanical effects
 in microbial evolution. Since then, I''ve studied transcriptional regulation in mammalian development, the role of evolution in tumor metastasis, and
 the ecology of benthic cyanobacterial mats. I''m broadly interested in the way evolutionary processes have shaped mechanisms for gene regulation.'

  description: 'From a young age, I was always interested in science, especially the science behind different diseases. I majored in Biomedical
  Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin to learn more about the real-world applications of scientific and medical research. At UT, I joined
  Dr. Aaron Baker''s lab and studied nerve damage after traumatic injury. There, I helped engineer and test neural microelectrodes, and I also published
  an undergraduate thesis on drug delivery methods that could speed up nerve regrowth. Now, in the Corces lab, I work on neurodegeneration in a different
  context as it relates to the epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer''s and Parkinson''s. My research experience has ignited in me a
  fascination with the brain, and I aim to join a neuroscience PhD program in the future.'
