  description: "I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early \"pre-leukemic\" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease."

  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Biochemistry and General Biology as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego. During my time there,
  I joined Dr. Derek Welsbie's ophthalmology lab focusing on the development of gene therapies/small molecules to mitigate degeneration in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with
  hopes for vision restoration in glaucoma patients. I had the opportunity to design plasmid constructs for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and to work on optimizing the
  differentiation of human STEM cells into RGCs. In my final quarter as an undergraduate, I was introduced to and amazed by the field of epigenetics which led me to join the
  Corces Lab where I could dive further into epigenomic profiling of major neurodegenerative diseases. When I'm not in lab, I like crocheting tiny plushies and trying new coffee places."

  ignited my passion for computing. After establishing a strong foundation in computer engineering from Pune University, I relocated to
  the US to attend Boston University to pursue my passion for Bioinformatics. I gained experience as a Research Assistant at the Daniel
  Segre Lab at BU, where I constructed a metabolic model pipeline and a GUI that helped examine the development of the root microbiome.
  I also had the opportunity to work as a Data Science and Bioinformatics intern at Pfizer, where I extensively worked with NLP models
  and techniques such as colocalization and fine-mapping studies for genetics research. I joined the Corces lab to gain exposure to and
  learn about single-cell technologies and neurodegenerative diseases. I'm now developing a web application for Variant Effect Prediction
  and a pipeline for in-house Multiome analysis. Outside of work, I love to draw, sing and dance to Bollywood music, watch movies, obsess
  about the clouds and read endlessly about MBTI personality types!"

  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area, then moved to the midwest to study Neuroscience and Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington
  University in St. Louis. There, I joined the lab of Yehuda Ben-Shahar and discovered that neuron-specific knockdown of one of the causative
  genes for Williams Syndrome—a rare developmental condition characterized by hypersociability—has an evolutionarily conserved effect, altering
  protein translation and social behavioral phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. I graduated in 2019, and after continuing for a year as lab
  manager, I joined the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at UCSF. As part of the Corces Lab, I am pivoting to study the genetic drivers of
  the more common and highly polygenic Alzheimer’s Disease. I aim to understand the cell type-specific effects of disease-associated noncoding
  genetic variants. My current efforts include profiling human brain tissue using single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq, conducting high-throughput
  functional genomics assays, and generating CRISPR-edited iPSC-derived models of brain cell types. I think glia (especially oligodendrocytes)
  are rad! Outside of lab, I can be found taking long walks with an iced coffee, or working toward my mission to find the best fried chicken

  neurodevelopmental diseases (and learned why neuroscientists also like neurons!). I moved across the country in 2023 to start my
  PhD in Neuroscience at UCSF, aiming to combine my background in iPSC systems with new genetic approaches. In the Corces lab, I

  description: "Growing up in rural Rhode Island, I was raised in the outdoors and turned this into a passion for biology with the help
  of dedicated early educators. Deciding to make a career out of this, I made the trek to Providence to study Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology at Brown University. There, I began my journey in research in the lab of Ashley Webb, investigating how the Forkhead Box O family
  of transcription factors (FOXOs) regulate stem cell homeostasis in the brain. I concurrently examined this functionality under
  physiological and pathological conditions, focusing the majority of my efforts on investigating a role for FOXOs in the maintenance of
  cancer stem cell quiescence in the context of high-grade brain cancer. Wanting to continue research on human disease, I switched coasts
  after graduation to pursue my PhD in the Biomedical Sciences Program at UCSF. Here, as a member of the Corces Lab, I aim to pair
  multi-omics with organoid and iPSC-based model systems to pinpoint and validate the epigenetic underpinnings driving AD and PD.
  In particular, I am interested in the interplay between such drivers and their contextual relationships in a cell-type and cell-state
  specific manner. Outside of lab, you'll find me working with UCSF's Science Education Partnership, exploring new ways to consume coffee,
  or making my way to a beach or a mountain."

  research included developing drug delivery systems using exosomes and self-assembling acid-cleavable nanoparticles. Under the
  supervision of Professor Autumn Ivy, MD, PhD, I completed my PhD. My research focused on answering the question, \"how does
  exercise in early life improve learning and memory?\" My investigation, which leveraged bulk CUT&RUN and RNA sequencing
  techniques, discovered support for a mechanism of epigenetic priming. Along the way, I developed a novel transgenic mouse line
  and a novel technique, SIT, for the cell-specific simultaneous isolation of nuclei and RNA from a single homogenate. I am
  excited to investigate memory at the other end of the life-cycle as part of the Corces Lab. I want to leverage multi-omic and
  single-cell sequencing techniques and bioinformatics tools to understand how the epigenome and the environment influence
  neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Frontotemporal Dementia. I also enjoy swing dancing, cooking, scootering,
  art, hiking, video games, board games, and card games."
