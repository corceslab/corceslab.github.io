  description: 'I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early "pre-leukemic" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer''s and Parkinson''s
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease.'
